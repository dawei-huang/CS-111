Files:
- README: contains description of our included files.
- lab3a.c: parses a *.img file in order to find information about the file system and prints it out. The information in lab3a is confirmed by the debugfs command.
- ext2_fs.h: contains the header file to the ext2 file system that we implemented in lab3a.
- Makefile: contains the makefile of the lab3a executable

Notes:
We had a lot of trouble implementing the indirect block references but after much struggling we think we got it!
